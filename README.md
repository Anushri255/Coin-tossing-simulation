# Coin Flip Simulation

This project is a simple coin flip simulation game where two players can select their choices (Heads or Tails), and the coin is flipped a random number of times. The player whose choice matches the outcome of the coin flip is declared the winner. The game also keeps track of the scores for each player.

## Features

- **Player Input**: Each player can enter their name and choose between "Heads" and "Tails."
- **Automatic Opposite Choice**: Player 2's choice is automatically set to the opposite of Player 1's choice.
- **Coin Flip Animation**: The coin flips a random number of times before landing on either heads or tails.
- **Score Tracking**: Scores are kept track of and displayed for each player.
- **Result Display**: Shows the result of the coin flip and announces the winner.
